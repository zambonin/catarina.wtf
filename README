A "Worldle" [1] clone but only with cities from the state of Santa Catarina in
Brazil. (A touch harder, I would say.)

The shapefile containing the geographic information of the state was obtained
from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). To convert
a single shapefile into SVG files for each city, the Mapshaper [2] application
was used via a custom Dockerfile and several other scripts, that can be found
inside the `static/geo` directory.

A live demo of the guessing game is available at [3].
